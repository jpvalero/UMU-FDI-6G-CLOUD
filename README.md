# UMU-FDI-6G-CLOUD
This repository contains the files used for the 6G-CLOUD mid-term demonstrator by FDI and UMU. 

## Title  
AI-Driven Self-Healing Operations for Energy-Efficient Dynamic Server (De-)Activation 

## Description 
This demonstrator showcases the capability of the Management and Orchestration Framework (MOF) to dynamically allocate resources based on data provided by the AI/ML Framework (AIMLF). A key aspect of this validation is the interaction between the MOF and the AIMLF to request and receive the appropriate AI/ML models. Once the models are transferred, the MOF can leverage them to implement intelligent resource management strategies that optimize system performance and efficiency.
